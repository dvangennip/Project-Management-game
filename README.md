## About the game
Managing a project with multiple tasks that depend on each other, using only limited workers, gets complex fast. This game simulates you organising a music festival by assigning workers to activities.

Are you able to organise the festival in time and within budget before it is on?

## How to play
You can drag and drop one of the workers below to assign them to activities. If more workers are assigned, the activity is completed faster. Not all activities can be done right away, some other activities may have to be completed first.

You can use standard workers and extra workers, the latter cost you more. Assigning more than one worker (up to a max of 2) to an activity also comes with an additional cost.

Once you've assigned workers, press Progress to advance the time.

While you try to stay on schedule, watch your ðŸ’° budget and handle any unexpected changes!

## Origins
This game is based on the simulation game by Ken Klassen (Brock University) and Keith Willoughby (Bucknell University), described in a 1998 document and subject of a [2003 journal paper][1].

## Known issues
This game was never put into action in a university course but the intent was to use it to teach the basics of project management. So while it technically works, there are some gotchas.
- Several of the items visually overlap
- No ability to scroll or zoom in
- Thereâ€™s currently only one scenario to play through
- No random events as time goes on to upset careful planning and give the game considerably more replay value
