## About the game

Managing a project with multiple tasks that depend on each other, using only limited workers, gets complex fast. This game simulates you organising a music festival by assigning workers to activities.

Are you able to organise the festival in time and within budget before it is on?

## How to play

You can drag and drop one of the workers below to assign them to activities. If more workers are assigned, the activity is completed faster. Not all activities can be done right away, some other activities may have to be completed first.

You can use standard workers and extra workers, the latter cost you more. Assigning more than one worker (up to a max of 2) to an activity also comes with an additional cost.

Once you've assigned workers, press Progress to advance the time.

While you try to stay on schedule, watch your ðŸ’° budget and handle any unexpected changes!
