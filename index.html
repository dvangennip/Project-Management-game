				<h1>Project management game</h1>
				<p>Managing a project with multiple tasks that depend on each other, using only limited workers, gets complex fast. This game simulates you organising a music festival by assigning workers to activities.</p>
				<p>Are you able to organise the festival in time and within budget before it is on?</p>
				<h2>How to play</h2>
				<p>You can <em>drag and drop</em> one of the workers below to assign them to activities. If more workers are assigned, the activity is completed faster. Not all activities can be done right away, some other activities may have to be completed first.</p>
				<div class="description-workers">
					<div class="worker worker-regular" title="Example of a regular worker">&#128049;</div>
					<div class="worker worker-extra" title="Example of an extra worker (costs more)">&#128046;</div>
				</div>
				<p>You can use <em>standard workers</em> and <em>extra workers</em>, the latter cost you more. Assigning more than one worker (up to a max ) to an activity also comes with an additional cost.</p>
				<p>Once you've assigned workers, press <span class="description-progress-button">Progress</span> to advance the time.</p>
				<p>While you try to stay on schedule, watch your budget and handle any unexpected changes!</p>
